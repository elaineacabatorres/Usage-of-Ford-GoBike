# Usage of Ford GoBike System Data
## by Elaine Acaba Torres


## Dataset

The chosen data was Ford GoBike System Data. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in 2019.

The original dataset had 183412 bike rides and 16 columns. In order to start the exploration, I had to assess and clean the data, creating a dataframe with the final columns to explore. This new dataset called gobike_archive1 contains columns like, member gender, member age, user type, day, month, start hour, period day, start weekday num, start weekday char, start time type to help with the exploration.


## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, I wanted to investigate the Ford GoBike System Data. This dataset provided columns that I could make some codes to extract the date, minutes, hour, and member age. I wanted to focus on using these columns to answer what are the factors influencing the bike rides. This could be type of users, gender, age, time of day, duration of usage per gender, per age. 

- Morning and afternoons are the busiest period of day over 'night' users
- Males predominate the member gender with over 70% over females
- Subscribers predominate with 90% over customers

I found that morning and afternoons are the period of days most busy due to the bikes being used for commuting users before and after work. Specifically, from 08h and 10h and 17h and 19h.

This service is being used mostly by subscribers as they compose 90% of the user types. This is due of using the bikes as mode of transportation for commuters. Nevertherless, the other 10% of the customers, uses the bikes mostly on the weekends for their leisure time in the city. 

I observed the males compose about 70% of the users for subscribers and customers. However, females takes the longest trips in duration minutes. 

During the exploration, we can observe that males are the gender with the most bike rides between subscribers and customers. Nevertheless, females are the gender with the longest trips in duration minutes.
